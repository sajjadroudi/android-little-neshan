## Bug
- When I select a destination and it shows me a path and I open the app again, It shows me my location not the whole path. Maybe it's because of observing user location.

## Feature
- Add search bar.

## Improvement
- Add data binding.
- Clean up drawables and resources.
- Define string resources.
- Handle disconnection to the internet.
- Maybe it's better to add progress bar.
- Use actions for navigation.
- Use parcelable instead of serializable.
